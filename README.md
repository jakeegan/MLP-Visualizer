# MLP Visualization
A program that visualizes the firing of a multi-layer perceptron network.

## Examples

![XOR](xor.gif?raw=true "XOR")

Here's an MLP network model of a XOR gate. In this example, the input is 0, 1 and the output is 1 (neuron fired). The nodes turn red to signify the firing of a neuron.

![Network](network.gif?raw=true "Network")

Here's a larger MLP network. The inputs, weights, and thresholds are all labelled.
